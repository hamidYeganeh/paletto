# Observability

This document captures logging, metrics, and alerting expectations.

## Logging

- Log errors with enough context to debug.
- Avoid logging secrets or personal data.

## Metrics

- Track request counts, error rates, and latency per endpoint.
- Define SLOs for core user flows (TBD).

## Alerts

- Alert on error rate spikes and latency regressions.
- Escalation path: TBD.
